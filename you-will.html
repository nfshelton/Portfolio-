          <p>Besides the inconvenience of the layout, there is a color associated with each class but the colors are never explained throughout the website, and thus have no significance. When we interviewed the staff, they said the website was confusing and that they really wanted to change it to make it more understandable.</p>

          <p>When we interviewed staff at the Runbase, and asked them if the classes were for all intensity levels, they assured us that they were. However, when we considered taking a class, we were extremely hesitant and intimidated because we did not match the fitness levels of everyone their site was showing.</p>

          <p>All of my sketches were inspired by prior research, and the information I received when interviewing the staff and clients of Adidas Runbase Berlin. The most widely shared complaint that I recorded was how difficult it was to navigate the website, and the time wasted trying to figure it out. In all of my sketches, I tried to optimize user friendliness, and also embody the point and mission of the company - which is to inspire a fitness lifestyle. Through this brainstorming, I experimented with highlighting different aspects of the brand, and different aspects of promotion. However, due to the fact that You Will ultimately functions from clients taking classes, I prioritized that, and decided to include it in my final solution.</p>

          <p>Due to the fact that this app is about promoting classes, I made it the first thing the user sees when opening the app. In this way, it is extremely straight forward for the user to find what they are looking for. All the classes are organized into four overall categories that summarize what the class is offering. Once the user goes into the category of their choice, they find all the classes offered there. After clicking the class they are interested in, they can find when the class is offered on the schedule. This is an alternate, and more organized way for the user to find out all the classes are offered, without them having to flip through each class on the calendar. There would also be a full calendar, but this would be a way for the user to be more familiar with what they are looking for.</p>

          <p>The more fleshed out version of the wireframe allows the user to get more personal in their interactions with the site. Some people I interviewed noted their intimidation with the Adidas Runbase site, because the people displayed were in much more advanced physically. Here, I tried to implement how friendly and inclusive the classes were by showing smiling faces, and neutral images of people working out. Likewise, I tried to emphasize the class atmosphere, showing that people would truly not be alone but be in an inclusive environment that welcomed them no matter where they were on their fitness journey. Likewise, a picture of the coach is shown so the user can already start to feel familiar with the class, and the difficulty level of the class is given so the user can decide where they would fit in.</p>

          <p>This was an extremely fun project to do. I really enjoyed researching Adidas Runbase Berlin, interviewing their staff and clients, and analyzing their site to see what worked, and what I would want to improve. It was a great experience to essentially rebrand what they had, and change it into my own brand, sample website, and sample app. I got to improve the major things that I personally wasn’t a fan of, and things that the people I interviewed didn’t like. Such as making it less intimidating at face value, creating a more inclusive platform, changing the UI to be more straight forward, and more personable - thus, doing things like showing the difficulty level of the classes, and a picture of the coach. It really helped me grow in my knowledge of designing for the user and making applications as user friendly as possible.</p>
